      "My study of the Roman Catacombs began in 1846.\n",
      "Two years later I published a series of letters upon\n",
      "the subject in the Rambler, and the substance of\n",
      "these, with some additions and corrections, was\n",
      "collected into a small volume in 1856. This was\n",
      "translated both into French and German, and a\n",
      "second English edition was published in 1859.\n",
      "But in 1864 and 1867 the first two volumes of De\n",
      "Rossi’s great work appeared; and these not only\n",
      "added indefinitely to our knowledge of particulars\n",
      "about the Catacombs, but also effected a complete\n",
      "revolution in the view to be taken of their history,\n",
      "and laid a new basis for the future study of them.\n",

      "Formerly, it had been taken for granted that the\n",
      "Christians had had recourse to this mode of burying\n",
      "their dead, only for the sake of the opportunities of\n",
      "secrecy which it afforded, and it was a difficult question\n",
      "for Christian archæologists to solve how it had\n",
      "been possible to carry on a work of such magnitude,\n",
      "under the very eyes (as it were) of the Pagan authorities,[viii]\n",
      "without detection. De Rossi set aside these\n",
      "speculations, and proved that there was no necessity\n",
      "for the early Christians to take exceptional precautions\n",
      "with reference to the burial of their dead, since\n",
      "many of the customs of their Pagan neighbours in\n",
      "this matter were such as they might themselves\n",
      "make use of, and, under ordinary circumstances, their\n",
      "cemeteries were adequately protected by the law.\n",
      "Henceforward, the manual of 1859 was not only\n",
      "incomplete, it had also been demonstrated to be incorrect.\n",
      "In 1869, therefore, a much larger volume\n",
      "was published by Rev. W. R. Brownlow and myself,\n",
      "founded upon the new discoveries. This also was\n",
      "favourably received by the public; the first English\n",
      "edition was soon exhausted, and translations were\n",
      "made both in France and Germany. A second and\n",
      "enlarged edition is now in course of preparation,\n",
      "which will embody the most interesting and important\n",
      "parts of De Rossi’s third volume, which has\n",
      "only just appeared. Meanwhile, however, there is\n",
      "need of a short manual, which shall be a safe guide\n",
      "to those who only desire to become acquainted with\n",
      "the leading features of the subject, according to the\n",
      "present condition of our knowledge of it; and with\n",
      "this view I have compiled the following pages, at a\n",
      "time when ill health has necessitated the suspension\n",
      "of more arduous labours. They do not pretend to\n",
      "give a complete account either of the past history or\n",
      "present condition of the Catacombs, but merely a\n",
      "correct outline of the whole, so that those who would[ix]\n",
      "pursue the study further shall, at least, have nothing\n",
      "to unlearn.\n",
      "I have called the volume “A visit to the Roman\n",
      "Catacombs,” because it describes the principal objects\n",
      "of interest which are to be seen in the visit now\n",
      "usually paid by educated travellers to the Catacomb\n",
      "of St. Callixtus. To this, however, I have prefixed\n",
      "half a dozen chapters, which make, in fact, three-fourths\n",
      "of the whole work, and in which I have condensed\n",
      "the information which every visitor ought to\n",
      "have before he descends into these subterranean\n",

      "tells us that when he was a schoolboy in Rome, he\n",
      "used to go every Sunday, in company with other\n",
      "boys of his own age and tastes, to visit the tombs of\n",
      "the apostles and martyrs, and to go down into the\n",
      "crypts excavated there in the bowels of the earth.\n",
      "“As you enter,” he says, “you find the walls on either\n",
      "side full of the bodies of the dead, and the whole\n",
      "place is so dark, that one seems almost to realise the\n",
      "fulfilment of those words of the prophet, ‘Let them\n",
      "go down alive into Hades.’ Here and there a little\n",

      "go forward, you find yourself again plunged into the[2]\n",
      "utter blackness of night, and the words of the poet\n",
      "come unbidden to your mind, ‘The very silence fills\n",
      "the soul with dread.’” Anybody who has frequented\n",
      "the Roman Catacombs will recognise the justice of\n",
      "this description; and if he is as familiar with Virgil\n",
      "and with the Psalms of David as St. Jerome was, he\n",
      "may have used something like the same language to\n",
      "describe his own impressions. But we are writing for\n",
      "those who have never seen the Catacombs at all, and\n",
      "we must therefore enter into more minute particulars.\n",
      "Let us first try to get a general idea of what the\n",
      "Catacombs are. And for this purpose let us transport\n",
      "ourselves in imagination to the city of Rome,\n",
      "and having been led out some two or three miles\n",
      "(more or less) almost on any of the fourteen great\n",
      "consular roads which went forth from the old centre\n",
      "of the world to its most distant provinces, let us go\n",
      "down, either by some modern staircase or through\n",

      "shall probably find ourselves landed in a dark narrow\n",
      "gallery, something like what is here represented—a\n",
      "gallery about three feet wide, and perhaps seven or\n",
      "eight feet high, cut out of the living rock, and its\n",
      "walls on either side pierced with a number of horizontal\n",
      "shelves, one above the other, like the shelves\n",
      "of a bookcase. We need hardly be told that each of\n",
      "these shelves once contained a dead body, and had\n",
      "then been shut up by long tiles or slabs of marble,\n",
      "securely fastened by cement, and inscribed perhaps[3]\n",
      "with the name of the deceased or with some Christian\n",

      "the subject in the Rambler, and the substance of\n",
      "these, with some additions and corrections, was\n",
      "collected into a small volume in 1856. This was\n",
      "translated both into French and German, and a\n",
      "second English edition was published in 1859.\n",
      "But in 1864 and 1867 the first two volumes of De\n",
      "Rossi’s great work appeared; and these not only\n",
      "added indefinitely to our knowledge of particulars\n",
      "about the Catacombs, but also effected a complete\n",
      "revolution in the view to be taken of their history,\n",
      "and laid a new basis for the future study of them.\n",

      "Formerly, it had been taken for granted that the\n",
      "Christians had had recourse to this mode of burying\n",
      "their dead, only for the sake of the opportunities of\n",
      "secrecy which it afforded, and it was a difficult question\n",
      "for Christian archæologists to solve how it had\n",
      "been possible to carry on a work of such magnitude,\n",
      "under the very eyes (as it were) of the Pagan authorities,[viii]\n",
      "without detection. De Rossi set aside these\n",
      "speculations, and proved that there was no necessity\n",
      "for the early Christians to take exceptional precautions\n",
      "with reference to the burial of their dead, since\n",
      "many of the customs of their Pagan neighbours in\n",
      "this matter were such as they might themselves\n",
      "make use of, and, under ordinary circumstances, their\n",
      "cemeteries were adequately protected by the law.\n",
      "Henceforward, the manual of 1859 was not only\n",
      "incomplete, it had also been demonstrated to be incorrect.\n",
      "In 1869, therefore, a much larger volume\n",
      "was published by Rev. W. R. Brownlow and myself,\n",
      "founded upon the new discoveries. This also was\n",
      "favourably received by the public; the first English\n",
      "edition was soon exhausted, and translations were\n",
      "made both in France and Germany. A second and\n",
      "enlarged edition is now in course of preparation,\n",
      "which will embody the most interesting and important\n",
      "parts of De Rossi’s third volume, which has\n",
      "only just appeared. Meanwhile, however, there is\n",
      "need of a short manual, which shall be a safe guide\n",
      "to those who only desire to become acquainted with\n",
      "the leading features of the subject, according to the\n",
      "present condition of our knowledge of it; and with\n",
      "this view I have compiled the following pages, at a\n",
      "time when ill health has necessitated the suspension\n",
      "of more arduous labours. They do not pretend to\n",
      "give a complete account either of the past history or\n",
      "present condition of the Catacombs, but merely a\n",
      "correct outline of the whole, so that those who would[ix]\n",
      "pursue the study further shall, at least, have nothing\n",
      "to unlearn.\n",
      "I have called the volume “A visit to the Roman\n",
      "Catacombs,” because it describes the principal objects\n",
      "of interest which are to be seen in the visit now\n",
      "usually paid by educated travellers to the Catacomb\n",
      "of St. Callixtus. To this, however, I have prefixed\n",
      "half a dozen chapters, which make, in fact, three-fourths\n",
      "of the whole work, and in which I have condensed\n",
      "the information which every visitor ought to\n",
      "have before he descends into these subterranean\n",
